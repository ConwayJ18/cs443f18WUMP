# cs443f18WUMP

JESS CONWAY - FINAL WUMP SUBMISSION - COMP 443 NETWORKS

wumppkt.java - Unmodified from the original
wclient.java - The standard, undergraduate version of the assignment. Functions as desired for all input files provided winsize=1.
HUMPclient.java - wclient.java, but with the addition of HUMP. Functions as desired for all input files provided winsize=1.
windows.java - wclient.java, but with an attempted addition of sliding windows. Still gives desired output for all winsizes, but the window doesn't seem to be working properly (either isn't saving early packets or isn't outputting ACKs correctly).

Output/<protocol>/sys.<stream>/ - Contains output files from testing for WUMP/WUMP, and System.out/System.error
